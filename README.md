* Based on the results for the retiring titles csv there are a combined total of 90,398 titles that are in the age range for retirement. 

* The title with the most retirement are the Senior Engineer with 29,414. 

* The title with the least retiring are Managers with 2. 

* Based on the mentorship eligibility file there are 1,549 employees elilgible for the mentorship program.

### Summary

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  * Based on the results of the retiring titles, 90,398 roles will need to be filed. The break down of the roles that need to be filled are 29,414 senior engineers, 28,254 senior staffs, 14,222 engineers, 12,243 staffs, 4,502 technique leaders, 1,761 assistant engineers, and 2 managers.

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  * Overall I believe there aren't enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. For exmaple, of the 29,414 senior engineers that are retiring. Only 208 are eligible to mentor the next generation. 208 mentors to fill one of the largest departments is not enough. For the Senior staff there are 521 out of the 28,254 that are eligible to mentor the next generation. for the engineers, 14,222 are retiring but only 465 are elgible to mentor the next generation. The staff have 203 eligible for mentorship out of the 12,243. The technique leader have 77 out of the 4,502 eligbile. The assistant engineers have 75 out of the 1,761, and lastly there are 0 managers. Below is a link to the mentorship_eligbile employees:
